Especially in the FCV % range granted, we see a lot of outliers. Do you have time to sit down and go through outliers, just to make sure there’s nothing else wrong with the data? A couple of the other charts also have some funny spots, such as $ value granted/not granted with the 2013 result.

For FCV/LPV decision summary line – can we have different colors? It’s very hard to distinguish.

On all the plots, can we have an asterisk noting that some years did not have a petition/data?

For all the graphs, can we have the y-axis information on the right side also? Many of the years we’re interested are later chronologically.

For graphs with dollar values (in the millions). Do you want both “dollars (in millions)” and the letter “M” next to the numbers? I’m split on this.

The size of the dots for the box plot are hard to distinguish. Is there another format we can use? Maybe size and a color scale?

For side by side comparisons of FCV and LPV on the same type of plot, can we make sure the y-axis is the same in terms of intervals?

This is a wild one: can we animate these plots so long year shows up at a time?

Can you provide a great analogy for why we should not be looking at a single year of data? Something that you would say to undergrads—i.e., something that will resonate with laypeople?

Row 40, regarding 102-04-044C’s petition in 2010 for the 2011 tax year. The LPV by Notice incorrectly states 650211. It should be 642211.

Row 44, regarding 102-01-012A’s petition in 2010 for the 2011 tax year. The correct FCV Decision and LPV decision should both be 1345207. It incorrectly states 1315207.

Row 4, regarding 105-22-023. Decision value should be 30000, not 47000.
